      <p>After finalizing the UI designs for the new navigation system, we conducted usability testing to gather feedback directly from users. This allowed us to identify areas that needed refinement based on real user experiences. We collected qualitative responses through user interviews, which provided key insights into how users interacted with the new navigation system and helped inform changes to improve usability.</p>
      <p>Usability testing revealed that users found the navigation clean, simple, and intuitive, with Module titles and the Our Platform section being well understood. However, some struggled with sections like Resources, mistakenly thinking it was for current users only. Additionally, Calls to Action like "Get started free" and "Free trial" resonated better when aligned with industry norms.</p>
      <p>Overall, these insights played a key role in refining the navigation, ensuring that it was not only visually appealing but also aligned with user expectations for seamless interaction.</p>
