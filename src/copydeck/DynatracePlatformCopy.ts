    title: 'The Challenge',
    body: `
      <p>The previous platform page was static and lacked a clear narrative, making it difficult for users to grasp Dynatrace's benefits. Engagement was low, with users often leaving without exploring further. The challenge was to create a dynamic, story-driven page that visually conveyed the platform’s complexity and value while meeting the needs of decision-makers and practitioners.</p>
      <div classname="ul-group">
      <strong>To address the distinct needs of our primary audience segments, I tailored the content as follows:</strong>
      <ul>
      <li><b>Decision-Makers (60-70%):</b> Focused on why Dynatrace is crucial for their organization, showcasing high-level benefits and strategic value.</li>
      <li><b>Practitioners (30-40%):</b> Highlighted how Dynatrace empowers individuals, offering practical insights into usage and personal success metrics.</li>

        <strong>To inform the redesign, I conducted a detailed competitive analysis:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Competitor Reviews:</b> Examined similar pages from industry leaders like DataDog and New Relic to identify standard practices and innovative elements.</li>
          <li><b>Component Analysis:</b> Created a matrix of common UI components (e.g., accordions, sliders, videos) to assess their effectiveness and potential for engagement.</li>
